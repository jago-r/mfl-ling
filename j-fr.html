<h1>How to pronounce &lt;j&gt; in French</h1>
<p>In French, the letter <strong><code>j</code></strong> is pronounced similarly to in English, but not exactly the same.</p>
<p>The French <strong><code>j</code></strong> has the same sound as the <strong><code>s</code></strong> in English ‘vision’.</p>
<p>In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this sound is represented <strong>/ʒ/</strong>, a ‘z’ with a tail.</p>

<p>The English <strong><code>j</code></strong> is made up of a <strong>/d/</strong>, then a <strong>/ʒ/</strong>, represented as <strong>/dʒ/</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore some French words which have the same sound as English <strong><code>j</code></strong> are spelt <code>&lt;dj&gt;</code> in French:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Djibouti (a country in Africa)</li>
  <li>Djenné (a town in Mali)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  1. Practice saying <strong>Jack</strong> in English, followed by <strong>Jacques</strong> in French, noting the difference in the first sound.<br />
  In the International Phonetic Alphabet, <strong>Jack</strong> is <code>/dʒak/</code> and <strong>Jacques</strong> is <code>/ʒak/</code>.
</p>

<p>2. Practise saying these words in French, noting how they sound different than the English equivalents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Justice</li>
  <li>Journaliste</li>
  <li>Journal</li>
</ul>
