    <h1>Linguistics for foreign languages</h1>
    <p>This site has information for secondary school students who are studying French, Spanish, German or Welsh and want to improve their language skills using linguistics.</p>
     <p>Linguistics is the study of how language works. If you wonder <b>why</b> something in a language is the way it is, you might be interested.</p>
        <p>Information on this site includes:
          <ul>       
            <li>How to produce different sounds found in these languages.</li>
            <li>How to read the languages spellings, and why they are spelt the way they are.</li>
            <li>Grammar patterns in the languages, and why and how these have developed.</li>
            <li>Explanations of word order in the languages.</li>
            <li>Some crucial variation that speakers of languages have.</li>
          </ul>
  </p>
    <p>This website includes some linguistics terminology, which can help you understand concepts better. Information about sounds uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (or IPA). This is a series of symbols used to represent sounds across all the languages of the world. This means you can avoid ambiguities in spelling systems. For example, the letter 'c' in English is pronounced in different ways in the words 'cat' and 'cent'. The IPA has a represents the sound consistently - the former is represented /k/ and the latter is represented /s/.</p>
