  <h1>How to pronounce &lt;ñ&gt; in Spanish</h1>

  <p>Spanish makes a difference between <strong>&lt;n&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;ñ&gt;</strong>. The former is pronounced the same as in English. The letter <strong>&lt;ñ&gt;</strong> sounds similar to the first ‘n’ in ‘onion’ in English, but not exactly the same.</p>

  <p>When you make an <strong>/n/</strong> sound in English, notice the position of your tongue. It should be at the front of your mouth, right behind the teeth. When you say a word like ‘yes’, for the first sound, the tongue is further back, on the roof of your mouth.</p>

  <p>In English, words like ‘onion’ have this <strong><code>n</code></strong> sound with the tongue at the front of your mouth followed immediately by the <strong><code>y</code></strong> sound with your tongue further back. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this is represented as the sequence <strong>/nj/</strong>.</p>

  <p>In Spanish <strong>&lt;ñ&gt;</strong> is a single sound, not a sequence of two. To produce it, keep your tongue in the position it is in for <strong><code>y</code></strong>, then make an ‘n’ sound without moving your tongue forward. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this is represented as <strong>/ɲ/</strong>, or ‘n’ with a tail on its left side.</p>

  <p>1. Practice saying the following pairs of Spanish words, paying attention to the position of your tongue. You don’t want to mix the first pair up!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Año</strong> (year) – <strong>ano</strong> (anus)</li>
    <li><strong>Uña</strong> (fingernail) – <strong>una</strong> (one)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>2. Practice saying the following common Spanish words:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Niña (girl)</li>
    <li>Señor (mister)</li>
    <li>España (Spain)</li>
    <li>Mañana (morning)</li>
  </ul>
