  <h1>How to pronounce &lt;gn&gt; in French</h1>

  <p>In French, &lt;gn&gt; is <b>not</b> pronounced like a sequence of /g/ and /n/. It sounds similar to the first <strong><code>n</code></strong> in ‘onion’ in English, but not exactly the same.</p>

  <p>When you make an <strong>/n/</strong> sound in English, notice the position of your tongue. It should be at the front of your mouth, right behind the teeth. When you say a word like ‘yes’, for the first sound, the tongue is further back, on the roof of your mouth.</p>

  <p>In English, words like ‘onion’ have this <strong><code>n</code></strong> sound with the tongue at the front of your mouth followed immediately by the <strong><code>y</code></strong> sound with your tongue further back. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this is represented as the sequence <strong>/nj/</strong>.</p>

  <p>In French <strong>&lt;gn&gt;</strong> is a single sound, not a sequence of two. To produce it, keep your tongue in the position it is in for <strong><code>y</code></strong>, then make an ‘n’ sound without moving your tongue forward. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, this is represented as <strong>/ɲ/</strong>, or ‘n’ with a tail on its left side.</p>

  <p>1. Practice saying the following pairs of French words, paying attention to the position of your tongue. These words form a <b>minimal pair</b>, as they only differ in one phoneme.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Peine</strong> (punishment) – <strong>peigne</strong> (comb)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>2. Practice saying the following French words:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oignon (onion)</li>
    <li>Agneau (lamb)</li>
    <li>Montagne (mountain)</li>
    <li>Gagner (to win)</li>
  </ul>
