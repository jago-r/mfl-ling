  <h1>How to pronounce &lt;ll&gt; in Welsh</h1>

  <p>In Welsh, the sequence <strong>&lt;ll&gt;</strong> is pronounced differently from a singular <strong>&lt;l&gt;</strong>. The sound is not found in English, and is quite distinctive to Welsh among the languages of Europe. The sound is similar to <strong>/l/</strong> and <strong>/s/</strong> in different ways. It is represented as <strong>/ɬ/</strong> in the International Phonetic Alphabet, or ‘l’ with a curl in the middle.</p>

  <p>1. Practise saying the English words <em>‘lip’</em> and <em>‘sip’</em>. Pay attention to the position of the tongue at the start of these words.</p>

  <p>You should feel that <strong><code>s</code></strong> has a flat tongue across the width of the mouth, whereas <strong><code>l</code></strong> has a more curved tongue, so that the sides of the mouth are further away from the tongue. As you make an <strong><code>s</code></strong> sound, you should feel hissing and friction that does not happen for <strong><code>l</code></strong>.</p>

  <p>To produce <strong>&lt;ll&gt;</strong>, put your tongue in the position it was in for <strong><code>l</code></strong>, so with a curved tongue and a large gap between the sides of the tongue and your teeth. You want to keep your tongue in this position, but make the actions for an <strong><code>s</code></strong> sound. The hissing and friction should come out from the sides of your mouth.</p>

  <p>2. <strong>&lt;ll&gt;</strong> becomes <strong>&lt;l&gt;</strong> under soft mutation. Practice the following pairs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Llaw</strong> (hand) – <strong>dwy lau</strong> (two hands)</li>
    <li><strong>Lliw</strong> (colour) – <strong>dau liw</strong> (two colours)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>3. Practice the following common Welsh words containing <strong>&lt;ll&gt;</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arall (other)</li>
    <li>Lle (place)</li>
    <li>Holl (all)</li>
    <li>Llys (court)</li>
  </ul>
